# Udacity A/B Testing Final Project ðŸ“ˆ
## What is this?
This repo contains the full code and data for my solution of the final project of 
[Udacity/Google's A/B testing course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ab-testing--ud257),
which I recently completed and would highly recommend!

If you are only interested in seeing how I solved the problem (and/or looking for hints...)
check out my interactive Streamlit app [here](https://ab-testing-project.herokuapp.com/).
